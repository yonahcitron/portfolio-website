- In the projects section, make h1 and h2 to the left, and the bullet points to the right
- Redo the other bullet point place to have li elements instead of manual bullet points
- Look up other templates for the project cards for ideas 
- Make some sort of animation for the project cards as well
- Set up the deployment with a git push rather than the current manual approach.
- Every time I redeploy, it removes the old custom domain. Make that part of the deployment pipeline too.
- The favicon isn't loading.
