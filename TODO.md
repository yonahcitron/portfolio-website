- Make the modal maybe pop up from the bottom and you can swipe down to make it disappear? I think that's a better modern modal style but Google about this ... "bottom sheet" or "sliding sheet"... especially on mobile. could actually just add it to the mobile version of the site actually, think about that. Enhance design of the site in general.
- Increase the sensitivity of scrolling through the porjects... happens too easily currently..
- often when I scroll through the projects, it scrolls multiple rather than just one... fix this...
- change from 'professional projects' to just 'projects'
- make the buttons which show project progress lower because currently they're overlapping
- maybe make some subtle animation when the carousel slides into view, like with the timeline? otherwise looks a bit stale
- Within each project, layout the text better for different screen sizes... when the screens big, currently it looks too spaced out... maybe make it adjust dynamically???
- Redo the other bullet point place to have li elements instead of manual bullet points
- Add colour to the expertise logos? Maybe make them the original ones that they were...
- Look up other templates for the project cards for ideas 
- Make some sort of animation for the project cards as well
- Set up the deployment with a git push rather than the current manual approach.
- Every time I redeploy, it removes the old custom domain. Make that part of the deployment pipeline too.
- The favicon isn't loading on the deployed site.
- There are 'about-container' css class definitions spread throughout multiple files.
  - Consolidate these into one.
- Make it so that when I hover on professional projects the mouse goes to a hand and a popup says 'click to learn more' 
- Doing the above will make it easier to CENTRE EVERYTHING, especially the h1's for each section,
  and the whole of my about section so that I appear in the middle, which it does anyway on smaller
  screens (and looks better imho).
- Then finally make the professional projects into a grid, with just the headers, which expand slightly
  when hovered over to show the subheading (and 'push' the others to the side a little bit), and then prompt
  with an icon to click to show all details, which makes it even bigger and pushes everything else further
  maybe? or maybe do the final stage as a modal, have a think! Also, currently I have five projects,
  but in general the format should be a grid with 2 colums.. but FIND A WAY THAT ANY STRAGGLING SINGLE
  COLUMNS WILL BE CENTERED IF POSS, E.G.:
                        X   X
                        X   X
                          X

        where 'X' is a project cell.

or do it:
  
                        X   X   X
                          X   X

    as this align better with the expertise format. or make the expertise section match with:

       X   X
         X

   have a think!!

- Make the section with my photo in it CENTERED.
- Make there be some sort of animation when I scroll to my projects section,
  similarish to the timeline - something subtle!
