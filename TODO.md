- In the projects section, make h1 and h2 to the left, and the bullet points to the right
- Redo the other bullet point place to have li elements instead of manual bullet points
- Look up other templates for the project cards for ideas 
- Make some sort of animation for the project cards as well
- Set up the deployment with a git push rather than the current manual approach.
- Every time I redeploy, it removes the old custom domain. Make that part of the deployment pipeline too.
- The favicon isn't loading on the deployed site.
- There are 'about-container' css class definitions spread throughout multiple files.
  - Consolidate these into one.
- Make it so that when I hover on professional projects the mouse goes to a hand and a popup says 'click to learn more' 
- Doing the above will make it easier to CENTRE EVERYTHING, especially the h1's for each section,
  and the whole of my about section so that I appear in the middle, which it does anyway on smaller
  screens (and looks better imho).
- Then finally make the professional projects into a grid, with just the headers, which expand slightly
  when hovered over to show the subheading (and 'push' the others to the side a little bit), and then prompt
  with an icon to click to show all details, which makes it even bigger and pushes everything else further
  maybe? or maybe do the final stage as a modal, have a think! Also, currently I have five projects,
  but in general the format should be a grid with 2 colums.. but FIND A WAY THAT ANY STRAGGLING SINGLE
  COLUMNS WILL BE CENTERED IF POSS, E.G.:
                        X   X
                        X   X
                          X

        where 'X' is a project cell.

or do it:
  
                        X   X   X
                          X   X

    as this align better with the expertise format. or make the expertise section match with:

       X   X
         X

   have a think!!

- Make the section with my photo in it CENTERED.
- Make there be some sort of animation when I scroll to my projects section,
  similarish to the timeline - something subtle!
